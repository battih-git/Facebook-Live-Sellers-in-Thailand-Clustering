# Facebook-Live-Sellers-in-Thailand-Clustering

Facebook pages of 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers. Posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses, and links). Engagement metrics consist of comments, shares, and reactions.

Additional Information

The variability of consumer engagement is analysed through a Principal Component Analysis, highlighting the changes induced by the use of Facebook Live. The seasonal component is analysed through a study of the averages of the different engagement metrics for different time-frames (hourly, daily and monthly). Finally, we identify statistical outlier posts, that are qualitatively analyzed further, in terms of their selling approach and activities.
